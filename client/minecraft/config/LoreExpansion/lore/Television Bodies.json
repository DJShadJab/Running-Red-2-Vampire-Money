Most think that Vampires are stereotypical bad guys with thick accents that hang around in coffins and suck blood. They think that all vampires are weak to a cross, that they're all the same.

They're not. They're not all the same. Noone is the same. Sure, some Vampires may desperatly want to kill, but other might not. Maybe some do sleep in coffins, and maybe some sleep in beds. Not everyone is the same.",
