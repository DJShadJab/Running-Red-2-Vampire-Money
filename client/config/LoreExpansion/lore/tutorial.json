	This story is not like most stories.
	
	Most stories tell the tale of someone creating a world from the lack of a world.
	
	This story is different. This story is about leaving the world.
	
	This story is about a human, a vampire, someone who has been bitten and is slowly changing.
	
	The end is near for this being. And this being only has one chance left to choose what to become.",
